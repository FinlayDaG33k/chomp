# Chomp
Library of (arguably) useful Deno classes.  
Should work just fine but comes with no warranties whatsoever.  

## Usage
Add the following to your file:
```ts
import * from "https://deno.land/x/chomp/mod.ts";
```

That's it!  
You can visit the [documentation](https://doc.deno.land/https://deno.land/x/chomp/mod.ts) to see what Chomp is capable off!  
Someday I'll write a better usage guide.
